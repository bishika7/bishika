Fig 1.1 summary:

When the programmer enters a program in the editor, it stores the file in the disk. 
The code is then processed by the preprocessor and transferred to the compiler. 
The compiler compiles the code and it enters the assembler which assembles the code and stores it on the disk.
Linkers take the object code from the assembler and links to the libraries and executes and stores it on the disk.
The loader then takes the code, puts in memory and prepares for execution.
The CPU takes the code and executes it, thus giving an output. The code gets stored in the disk.
