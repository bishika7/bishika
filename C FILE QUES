WHAT IS COMPILING?
   A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or "code" that a computer's processor uses.
WHAT IS DEBUGGING?
   Debugging is the routine process of locating and removing computer program bugs, errors or abnormalities, which is methodically handled by software programmers via debugging tools.
WHAT IS AN ERROR?
   error is a bug in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly, but not to terminate abnormally (or crash).
WHAT IS INT MAIN AND VOID?
   The keyword int to the left of main indicates that main “returns” an
   integer (whole number) value
   The void in parentheses here
   means that main does not receive any information.
WHAT IS PRINT F?
   When the preceding printf statement
   is executed, it prints the message Welcome to C! on the screen. 
WHAT IS RETURN O?
   When the return statement is used at the end of main as shown
   here, the value 0 indicates that the program has terminated successfully.
WHAT IS #INCLUDE STDIO.H?
What actually happen is the preprocessor reads #include and it understands that there is something which has to be included ( copied and use the information from there) and then it reads (<) and it understand that the file which has to be included is in a special place defined by the operating system where header files for the C library are held. And then it will search the file named stdio.h and then it will copy the contents. Generally preprocessor includes headers that come with the compiler.
